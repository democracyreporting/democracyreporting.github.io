# democracyreporting.github.io

This was part of a election project. It uses our front "website" space due to design failure.
Once deleted the link in a Newsletter will no longer work, but nonetheless I would recommend this be deleted one day IF (better WHEN) you decide to make a proper front page for DRI's Github.
